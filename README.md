Home automation system with indoor positioning abilities.

I am an electrical engineering student and I am looking at developing a home automation system with indoor positioning abilities. 
What this means: 
*Each person living in the house can have custom preferences for how the house behaves

*The house knows where each individual user is in order to provide the best possible automation

*Requires you only to have your phone in your pocket as you move around the house

Scenario: You wake up walking to the kitchen, coffee is ready with cream and one sugar, just how you like it. 
Get home from work, house greets you, "welcome home master John, you have a meeting tonight at 5 and 4 unread emails in your inbox."


Goals:
1. Focus on indoor positioning abilities. The Raspberry Pi needs to be able to locate a single user in the house
2. Plot this point on screen, likely through python
3. Facilitate more users
4. Implement automation system utilizing tracking/positioning abilities
